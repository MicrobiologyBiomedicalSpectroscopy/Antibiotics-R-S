# Antibiotics-R-S
This repo contains demonstrations of using classic machine learning algorithms to determine the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s as sensitive or resistant to to various antibiotics based on their mid-infared absorption spectra.

This repository is adapted to produce the results in the paper "Infra-red spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms enables early determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s susceptibility to antibiotics Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy"
