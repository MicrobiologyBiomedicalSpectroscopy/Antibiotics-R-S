# Antibiotics-R-S
This repo contains demonstrations of using classic machine learning algorithms to classifying wheather an FTIR spectra of pathogenic bacteria is resistant or sensitive to various antibiotics.

This repository is adapted to produce the results in the paper "Infra-red spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms enables early determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosaâ€™s susceptibility to antibiotics Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy"
